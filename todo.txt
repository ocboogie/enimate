 - [x] Either simulate strokes on the CPU by sending two meshes to the GPU as
   different draw calls, or implement it into the shader?
 - [x] Add scenes in scenes that have different time scales (i.e., I could have a 
   scene in a scene that has a specific range of time and a different time scale
 - [x] Add debugging tech like outlines and wireframes (perhaps in the shader)
 - Make motions more efficient by using references for their objects 
   and have the Motion trait have a lifetime
 - [x] Root motions should not be in builder state 
   - [x] Actually should probably refactor the whole thing
 - [ ] Move everything to cgmath instead of using bits of egui
 - [ ] MoveTo -> MoveTo Hard to do because of the way the builder pattern works
 - [ ] Maybe motions should be called commands?
